## Welcome to Collaborative Software Development Club!

Welcome to the Collaborative Software Development Club organization on GitHub, a community of passionate developers.

## About Us

Our mission is to create a space where students can come together to collaborate on software projects, regardless of their affiliation with the OSU curriculum. Our focus is on offering real-world experience and the opportunity to build portfolios. We will convene weekly meetings where participants can showcase their advancements in ongoing projects, propose new project ideas, and seek assistance when necessary. Although we primarily target CSE and CIS students, we welcome anyone with a background in software development to join us.
